Script for automatic login bonus claiming in the mmorpg drakensang online.

This script currently only works on windows as that's where I wrote it.
Not that drakensang even works on Linux, I mean it does, as long as you're fine with playing without a mouse cursor.

Anyway this is a very basic script and it does work quite well.


So to make this script work you're going to have to drop the folder containing it inside C:\Program Files\
So if you did that correctly the folder structure should look like this:
C:\Program Files\Drakensang Online Automatic Login Bonus

Then you have to put in your login data.
For that you edit line 24 and 31 in "lgn.py".
Replace "YOUR_USER_HERE" with your username and "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE" with your password.

The script currently only logs you into the heredur server but I have the material to make it work on other servers as it's really just an easy replacement but I don't play the game actively anymore or at all really.

The script also only really works on 1080p monitors as I used pixel coordinates to make some things work faster and better.
You can try it with lower or higher resolutions if you want but it probably won't work.

Anyway have fun.
